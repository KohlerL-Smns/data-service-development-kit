In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is necessary to implement - and continuously maintain - a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens’ products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept. Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) are in place. For additional information on industrial security measures that may be implemented, please visit: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more secure. Siemens strongly recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are available and that the latest product versions are used. Use of product versions that are no longer supported, and failure to apply latest updates may increase customer’s exposure to cyber threats.

With Industrial Edge, you use intelligence and scalability of the cloud directly in your manufacturing - in a simple, high-performance manner and without your data leaving the manufacturing process. Industrial Edge combines local and high-performance data processing directly in automation with the advantages of the cloud: app-based data analysis, data processing and Infrastructure-as-a-Service concepts with central update functionality. In this way, you can quickly integrate apps into manufacturing and manage them with a high degree of automation. Industrial Edge gives you the opportunity to continuously make changes to your automation components and plants, analyze large volumes of data in automation to realize innovative functions, such as preventive maintenance, and to obtain maximum flexibility and thus productivity over the entire machine life cycle. With the Industrial Edge Hub, an App Store is available to you where you can find all Siemens apps and 3rd-party apps. From here, you can manage all licenses for your apps and devices centrally and install updates for security issues, device firmware, apps and Industrial Edge Management. You can monitor and manage distributed Edge devices centrally in Industrial Edge Management. In this way, for example, new apps and software functions can be installed on all connected Edge devices company-wide. Central software management thus minimizes the workload for performing maintenance and updates on individual devices. On the individual Edge devices, you can start and run apps and keep statistics on an Edge device, for example. With the Industrial Edge Publisher, you can develop your own Edge apps and make them available to other users in Industrial Edge Management. Another component of the Industrial Edge ecosystem is Industrial Edge Runtime, which is installed on Edge Devices (IED) or Unified Comfort Panels (UCP) and on which the system, including all applications, ultimately runs.';

Siemens Industry Online Support By default, the data is kept for a maximum of one week. Max 20 GB data memory Docker Docker simplifies the deployment of apps because defined programs and environments can be transferred to another system with minimal effort. Explanation of terms Docker file: A text file that describes an image with various commands. These are processed during execution and a single layer is created for each command. Image: A memory dump of a container. The image itself consists of several layers that are read-only and thus cannot be modified. Several containers can always be started from one image. Container: The active instance of an image is referred to as container. This means that the container is currently running and is busy. The container is automatically terminated as soon as the container is not running a program or is finished with its job. As a rule, one application runs per container. Repository: A repository is a set of images of the same name with different tags, mostly versions. Data Service Development Kit Bundle You can download the Data Service Development Kit Bundle to your computer from the Siemens Industry Online Support. The bundle includes the following components: Docker file: docker-compose.yml User documentation OpenAPI specification Application example The image is loaded from the Docker Hub: Docker image Data simulator MQTT Broker Data Service (with external interface (REST API) for non-Siemens applications)';
